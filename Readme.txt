This C# Dot Net code will create Kml based on the 2.2 specification.

The code was developed using Visual Studio 2008 and Dot Net 2.0.

DotNetKml22Library is the dll and DotNetKml22Library.Tests includes test cases.

DotNetKml22Library
------------------

This code was written using the google kml reference.  Most object/types are named after the kml object, however,
some of the types were renamed to follow Microsoft standards (e.g. user "Color" instead of "color" and 
"Angle180" instead of "angle180".
